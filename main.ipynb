When the meeting is complete, I prepare a new agreement, sign it and send it to the Resort Manager. They also view their newly added resort details using our VPRU system to ensure that they look good to our VPRU customers We need to replace the previous agreements with our existing resort partners because we will only offer discounted vacation packages. Then, I will request our VPRU Operations Manager to add a new resort account to our VPRU system.\n"
