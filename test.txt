Six weeks before the trip starts, the VPRU system will send a reminder to the
primary guest. When the primary guest pay the remaining balance on or before the
cut-off date (i.e., 30 days before trip start date), the VP booking status is set to "fully
paid". The primary guest will receive a full refund if the VP booking is cancelled on
or before the cut-off date. Once the initial deposit refund is processed, the VP
booking status is set to "refunded". If the VP booking is cancelled after the cut-off
date, there is no refund and the VP booking status is set to "cancelled". If the owner
of the group failed to act on the reminder after the cut-off date, VPRU system will
change the VP booking status from "deposit received" to "expired" and the primary
guest will not get a refund. VPRU system will remove the previously assigned
vacation packages (i.e., along with their resort rooms) from all VP bookings that are
"refunded", "cancelled" and "expired", and these VP bookings will no longer be
associated with a vacation package. Any of these unassigned vacation packages will
be available for other VPRU customer to book. A vacation package that is already
assigned to a VP booking cannot be assigned to another VP booking (i.e., no
double-booking allowed)
